## Overview

**UrbanPlus: World Reimagined** was officially initiated on **May 22, 2025 at 8:00 PM EST**.

This is an early-stage development project with **primary support for FiveM servers**.  
**Story Mode support is not planned until full release**, though this may be reevaluated as development progresses.

UrbanPlus includes a growing set of environmental changes and YMAP-based expansions across the San Andreas map.

> This requirement resolves map holes and world inconsistencies that may occur when updating props or IPL-based assets at scale.
