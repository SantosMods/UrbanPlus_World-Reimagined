## bob74_ipl Requirement

Starting with recent builds, **UrbanPlus** now requires **bob74_ipl version 2.4.1**:  
➡ [Download bob74_ipl 2.4.1](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl/releases/tag/2.4.1)

> This requirement exists to address map holes that may occur during updates. Such issues are common when working with large-scale world modifications that involve a significant number of props and IPL overrides.

Due to bob74_ipl being licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl/blob/master/LICENSE), we are permitted to include it directly within our releases for ease of installation. Moving forward, **bob74_ipl v2.4.1 will be bundled with all UrbanPlus distributions**.
